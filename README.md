# The-Great-Senshado-War
The Great Senshado War is a Hearts of Iron IV total conversion mod themed around Girls und Panzer.
The mod should work as intended after the necessary playtesting and prototyping but if you encounter any bugs or issues, commenting them on the steam workshop page should get it seen and fixed ASAP. As always, Girls und Panzer is not my intellectual property, and is instead owned by Actas.
